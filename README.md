This is a tool for making modded ps3 customizations easier

## Features ##
* Upload single customization
* Upload a set of customizations
* Remove singrar from your CFW
* Set a PSN motd (coming soon)
* Reboot your console (uses webman API)
* Set everything back to stock-ish (won't roll back to OWF)

## Usage ##
Launch the application once, it will create a folder in your home ("c:\user\yourname\PS3 Customization" on windows)
Put a folder with the name of the customization inside the correct customization type with the original file name.
Example:

```
#!text

-PS3 Customization
--Boot sounds
---Stock
----coldboot_multi.ac3
----coldboot_stereo.ac3
---Classic
----coldboot_multi.ac3
----coldboot_stereo.ac3
--Waves
---Stock
----lines.qrc
```

## Common issues ##
You must first disable WebMan's integrated FTP and use Rebug toolbox or MultiMan integrated FTP or it won't work
